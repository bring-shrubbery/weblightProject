-----------README-----------
This is a sketch for controlling our 2nd year project. Not everything is optimised in this version, but will be in the next.

To get this thing running you will need 'node.js' with 'npm' and 'mongodb' installed on your computer, then follow these steps:
1. In MongoDB create a database called 'weblightDatabase' and make 3 collections inside called: 'lightBulb', 'plug' and 'switch'.
2. Insert data in those according to the structure of models in models folder.
3. Run 'mongod' in shell.
4. After that you may run 'index.js' file from node.
5. If everything works as expected, open web browser and enter: 'http://localhost:3000/'

KNOWN ISSUES:
-If database doesn't have any presets, it's impossible to add a new one. Solvable by using classes to define objects instead of directly modifying object.
-Since this version doesn't write anything to database, it will reset state of devices in the list on your left every time that you change category. It resets them to the state saved in database. Solvable by saving changes to database, which is crucial to our project functionality.
